## Design
Spoofax is a platform for developing textual domain-specific languages, and this
is represented in the logo by the curly brackets most programmers are familiar with.
The typeface is [_Kadwa_](https://github.com/huertatipografica/Kadwa), an
open-source font. The font was chosen to have monospace characteristics, yet be
distinctive. The `S` in the logo is almost same color as the default color for
keywords in Spoofax editors, which is color `#AD297E` (RGB: 173, 41, 126).
The curly braces are a tint of grey `#66625D` (RGB: 102, 98, 93).
Both colors where picked to stand out on both light and dark backgrounds.
The other characters are a dark grey `#231F20` (RGB: 35, 31, 32).
